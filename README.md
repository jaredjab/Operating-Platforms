# Operating-Platforms CS230

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is a company with a pre-existing game that they would like to turn into a cross-platform web-based game. The game involves players guessing the puzzle based on the images provided. A game includes four one-minute rounds of teams guessing the image. If a team does not correctly guess within the minute limit, then the other team has 15 seconds to offer a single guess to take the point. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My research and understanding of a REST API and how a client-server framework functions was where I would say I excelled in this project.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document kept everything very organized throughout the entire process. The design document also allowed for early planning to dictate what coding language and framework to use. Without the document, I would have likely been rewriting code after figuring out it had to be written using a different API.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my Recommendations section. I could take a lot more time to research the specific services and details for every step of how the game will function from top to bottom. A full list of service providers, pricing, and framework choices with the reasoning behind them would be useful.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by considering the user's perspective when using the application. Each part of the application they interact with and how it communicates to the server is important. It is also important to consider the different operating systems they will potentially be using. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs when designing because that full list of needs is the goal to be met at the end of development. Identifying those needs as goals and working backward to figure out how to accomplish those needs is a great way to start designing a program.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by considering how each function of the game would be implemented as well as whether that implication would be client or server-side. When different operating systems are ultimately working together, consistent style and compatibilities must be considered. The same goes for different programming languages when polyglot programming.
